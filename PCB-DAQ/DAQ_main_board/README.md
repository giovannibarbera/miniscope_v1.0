# Data acquisition board design files

These are the gerber files for the data acquisition system. Use the text file PCB_specs_DAQ.docx as a reference for the board specification and DAQ (Component positions).csv as a placement file when ordering.
This DAQ supports dual LED and is wi-fi ready through the TI CC3000 module.
